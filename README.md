# Gossip App

Our team used ns3 to simulate the gossip protocol.

## How to run the simulation

1. Put code in the ns3 directory according to the name of the folder.
2. Run bash script in the ns3 top directory.

## Compiling Bug
On Mac OS, it seems it couldn't compile. It maybe the linker issue with the Mac system.

It is fine with Linux system though.

## Random Topology files
They are generated using random geometric graph.

Number of Nodes: 100, 250, 400, 550, 700, 850, 1000, 1150, 1300, 1450, 1600.

Flase topologies are 100_30, 100_44, 100_53, 100_71, 100_79, 100_80
